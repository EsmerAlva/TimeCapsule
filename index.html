<div class="opening">The Purpose of this time capsule is to give a collection on important events that revoled around the call-out/outrage/cancel culture that appeared throughout 2015-2019 for viewers, thats you 2029 guys, to read, think, and form your own opinions of these events. Call out culture as defined by wikipeadia is "is the social phenomenon of publicly denouncing perceived racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, national interest, and other forms of bigotry. Denunciation can happen in person or online." It is important to note that the vast majority of people during this time have access to internet and therefore even things said in person usually end up online.</div>
