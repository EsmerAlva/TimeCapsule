Call out culture as defined by wikipeadia is "is the social phenomenon of publicly denouncing perceived racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, national interest, and other forms of bigotry. Denunciation   can happen in person or online." It is important to note that the vast majority of people during this time have access to internet and therefore even things said in person usually end up online.</div>
